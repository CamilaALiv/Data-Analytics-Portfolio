Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I'm an entry-level data analyst who is currently studying and gaining experience using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data in order to inform business decisions. Currently, my focus of study includes Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.
